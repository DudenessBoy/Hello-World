### Rust
Rust is a system programming language developed by a Mozilla employee "Graydon Hoare" in 2006. It is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety without requiring a garbage collector or reference counting. Rust is free and open source software, and its syntax is similar to C++.
