### Dart
Dart is a general-purpose programming language originally developed by Google and later has been standardized. It is used to build web, server, and mobile applications. It's getting more and more exposed through Flutter cross-platform mobile development framework. Dart is an object-oriented, class defined language using the good-old C-style syntax that can be optionally compiled into JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, static typing, and a sound type system.
