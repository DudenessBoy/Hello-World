### PowerShell
PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework developed by Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language. It was initially released in 2006 as Windows PowerShell, built on the .NET Framework. In 2016, Microsoft open-sourced PowerShell and released PowerShell Core, a cross-platform version based on .NET Core, broadening its reach to Linux and macOS. It is especially known for its integration with Windows systems and its use of cmdletsâ€”lightweight .NET classes for performing specific functions.
